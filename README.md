# odin-etch-a-sketch

The etch-a-sketch allows users to create pixel art in a responsive grid format. Built primarily using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** The sketchpad features a resizable dynamically generated 16x16 grid of squares.
- **Flexbox Layout:** Each square is perfectly aligned using Flexbox, providing a seamless grid appearance without the use of CSS Grid.
- **Interactive Coloring:** Squares change color when hovered over, leaving a pixelated trail that mimics the movement of a pen on paper.
- **Customizable Grid Size:** A button allows users to specify the number of squares per side, enabling the creation of grids as large or as small as desired, up to a maximum of 100x100 squares.

## Advanced Features

- **Color Randomization:** Each square can randomly change colors with each interaction.
- **Progressive Darkening:** Squares progressively darken with each hover interaction, simulating a shading effect that can reach full saturation after a few passes.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** Powers the core functionality including grid generation, hover effects, and interactive elements.
- **HTML:** Structures the web page and hosts the sketchpad container.
- **CSS:** Styles the sketchpad and controls the layout using Flexbox.
